  "Tip_5_16": "As a Medic, the Übersaw will still increase your ÜberCharge meter if the enemy being hit is a Scout phasing with Bonk! Atomic Punch.",
  "Tip_5_17": "As a Medic, using ÜberCharge to be invulnerable to damage does not mean you are free from harm. Watch out for the Pyro\u0027s compression blast and explosive knock back.",
